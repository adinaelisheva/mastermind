### Mastermind as She is Played

The goal of Mastermind is to guess the 4-color code as quickly as possible. Your score is the number of guesses before you get 
the correct answer, so as in golf, a lower score is better. 

When a guess is submitted, it is scored with black and white pegs:

- A black peg means one of the colors is in correct and in the same place as it is in the code. 
- A white peg means a correct color has been guessed, but is not in the correct place. 

The order of the black and white pegs does not correspond to the order of the colors guessed.
