        <h3>Welcome to Mastermind!</h3>
        <p>
          The goal is to guess the 4-color code the computer has generated as quickly as possible. Your score is the number of guesses
          before you get the correct answer, so as in golf, a lower score is better.
        </p><p>
          To guess, click on the colors to add them to the current row. The currently selected spot is indicated with a <code>^</code>.
        </p><p>
          When a guess is submitted, the computer will score it with black and white pegs. A black peg means one of the colors is in 
          correct and in the same place as it is in the code. A white peg means a correct color has been guessed, but is not in the 
          correct place. The order of the black and white pegs does not correspond to the order of the colors guessed.
        </p><p>
          For a new game, reload the page. Happy guessing!
